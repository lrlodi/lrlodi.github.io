This repository will maintain a Portfolio of my projects while a student at Trybe.

WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO REPOSITORY!

While being a student at this great scholl called Trybe I'll develop several projects to practice all recently learned skills.
By navigating through this repo you will be able to check every code and page written by me. I'll do my best to keep this page on track with the course content.

This repository will serve it's purpose if it forces me to practice the knowledge and spread out the word about my work.

Thanks for coming!
